If the first is not a closure, it is an error. 
Else, it evaluates the closure's function's body in the closure's environment extended to map
the function's name to the closure (unless the name field is #f) 
and the function's argument-name (i.e., the parameter name) to the result of the second subexpression.

Then it evaluates the second expression to a value, 
in an environment extended to map the name in the mlet expression to v.
